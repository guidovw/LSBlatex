# LSBlatex
Files needed for the Papers of the LSB style in Latex:
1. lsb.cls: the document class file. Put this in a location where latex can find it (eg ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex)
2. LSBpapers--template.tex: an example of an article in the LSB style
3. sample.bib: the sample bibliography file used for the example article in 2
4. lsb.bst: the bibliography style. Put this in a location where latex can find it (eg ~/Library/texmf/bibtex)
5. cgloss.sty (needed for glosses in the lsb document class; not standardly included in the tex-distribution; put this in a location where latex can find it, eg ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex)

There is also a sample document in MS Word "Guidelines for Papers of the LSB", which contains the styles needed for making a Word version of your paper. The styles are also contained in the style file BKLtempl.dot.
