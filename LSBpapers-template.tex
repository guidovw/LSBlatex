\section{General}

Manuscripts are accepted in Dutch, French, English and German. Should your contribution be in English, please make a consistent choice between British and American spelling. When submitting the initial manuscript to the editors of the volume, make your paper anonymous, and  add a separate sheet with the full title of the work, your full name, affiliation, as well as current mailing and e-mail address.

The contributions should not exceed the limit of 4600 words (including footnotes, references etc.). 

\section{Electronic files}

Please name the file with the first three letters of the (first) author’s last name. Do not use the three-character extension for things other than the identification of the file type (smi.doc, not smi.new or smi.rev). 

\section{Using the electronic templates}

\subsection{\LaTeX\ }
Contributions in \LaTeX\ are strongly preferred. A template containing all the necessary files is available at \url{}. 

\subsection{MS Word}

A template for MS Word files (BKLtempl.dot) is also available. Make use of the electronic template, as this automatically takes care of the most important formatting aspects of your document. 

Please use the appropriate predefined styles in the template.

\ex. \begin{tabular}[t]{llll@{\hskip 36pt}}
TITLE			& Title of your article\\
SUBTITLE		& Subtitle of your article\\
AUTHOR		& Your name\\
AFFILIATION	& Your affiliation\\
ABSTRACT	& 	Abstract\\
utitle0,u	& 	Unnumbered section heading (for notes, references)\\
Vtitle1, v	& 	Section heading, first level\\
Wtitle2, w	& 	Section heading, second level\\
Xtitle 3, x	& 	Section heading, third level\\
Quote, q	& 	Block quotation\\
Table, t	& 	Table\\
Figure, f	& 	Figure\\
Example, e	& 	Example\\
Notes, n	& 	Notes\\
References, r	& 	References\\
Scaps, sc	& 	small caps\\
IPA		& 	IPA signs \\
/1, /2, /4	& 	White line (whole, half, quarter)   \\
\end{tabular}

The running heads will be generated automatically if you have filled in the appropriate information under File – Properties – Summary info.


\subsection{Margins}

It is not possible to fix the settings of the margins in the electronic style, and copying material into the document may change the margin settings. Please check the margin settings before you start formatting your article and before you submit it to the editors. The margin settings should be (on the basis of A4 paper size):

\ex. \begin{tabular}[t]{llll@{\hskip 36pt}}
Top 	&	7,20 cm\\
Bottom &	5,85 cm\\
Left 	&	4,75 cm\\
Right &		4,75 cm\\
Header &	6,20 cm\\
Footer 	&	1,25 cm\\
\end{tabular}


\section{Font enhancements}

Font enhancements (such as italics, bold, caps, small caps, etc.) within the text must also be supplied by you. Whatever formatting or style conventions are employed, please be consistent.

Please use italics for foreign language words, highlighting and emphasis. Bold should be used only for highlighting within italics and for headings. Please refrain from the use of FULL CAPS (except for focal stress and abbreviations) and underlining (except for highlighting within examples, as an alternative for boldface), unless this is a strict convention in your field of research.


\section{Quotations}

In the main text quotations should be given in double quotation marks. Quotations longer than 3 lines should be formatted as block quotations, without quotation marks and with the appropriate reference to the source.


\section{Examples and glosses}

Examples should be numbered with Arabic numerals in parentheses.

\exg. Kare wa besutoseraa o takusan kaite-iru\\
he \textsc{top} best-seller \textsc{acc} many write-\textsc{pfv}\\
\glt ‘He has written many best-sellers.’ 

Please note that the interlinear gloss gets no punctuation and no highlighting. In MS Word,  The example and its gloss are lined up through the use of spaces; make sure the number of elements both lines match. If one word in language A corresponds to two words in language B use a full stop to glue the two together. Morphemes are separated by hyphens. For the abbreviations in the interlinear gloss use small caps. Consult the Leipzig Glossing Rules (\url{https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/pdf/Glossing-Rules.pdf}) for a list of standard abbreviations.

\section{Tables and figures}

In \LaTeX, tables and figures are treated as floats. This means that their placement on the page will not necessarily be where you put it in your manuscript, as this may lead to large parts of the page ending up white (e.g. when a table or figure does not fit on the current page anymore and wraps onto the following page). For this reason, you must always refer to tables and figures in the running text, as in the following example: `In certain languages, the superlative transparently contains the comparative morphologically, as illustrated in Table \ref{tbl:table1} \citep[46]{Bobaljik2012}.' Do not refer to tables and figures using the words `following', `below' or `above', as the final placement of your table or figure may be different from where you placed them in your manuscript.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Morphological containment}	
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
 & \textsc{Pos} & \textsc{Cmpr} & \textsc{Sprl}\\
\hline 
Persian & kam & kam-tar & kam-tar-in & ‘little’\\Cimbrian & šüa & šüan-ar & šüan-ar-ste & ‘pretty’ \\
Czech & mlad-ý & mlad-ší & nej-mlad-ší & ‘young’\\Hungarian & nagy & nagy-obb & leg-nagy-obb & ‘big’\\
Latvian & zil-ais & zil-âk-ais & vis-zil-âk-ais & ‘blue’\\Ubykh &  nüs\textsuperscript{w}ə & ç’a-nüs\textsuperscript{w}ə & a-ç’a-nüs\textsuperscript{w}ə & ‘pretty’ \\
\end{tabular}\label{tbl:table1}
\end{table}

Number your tables and figures consecutively, and provide  appropriate captions. The caption goes at the top of tables and at the bottom of figures.

\section{Notes}

Notes should be kept to a minimum and not be used for references. Note indicators in the text should appear at the end of sentences and follow punctuation marks.

\section{References}

It is essential that the references are formatted according to these guidelines. Examples of references in the text:

\ex.[]
\a.[] ``Hayes (1995a) has proposed to use \ldots''
\b.[] ``\ldots\ if it is followed by a yer (Rubach 1993:144).''
\b.[] ``\ldots\ (see for example Yarmohammadi 1973, and Baynham 1991), \ldots''

Examples of references in the reference section: see the next section.
